## Alternative installation methods

If you wish to install odoo separately from a docker image you can do so following the following instructions:

**Please note that Shopinvader can be setup and hosted by [Acsone](https://www.acsone.eu/page/homepage) or [Akretion](https://akretion.com/en)!**

### Odoo's manual installation

#### Simple Installation

To simply try out Shopinvader in a new Odoo 12 install, here are the lines to copy in a requirement.txt file:

<br/>

```
--find-links https://wheelhouse.acsone.eu/manylinux1
--extra-index https://wheelhouse.shopinvader.com/simple/
--extra-index https://wheelhouse.odoo-community.org/oca-simple/
-r https://raw.githubusercontent.com/odoo/odoo/12.0/requirements.txt
https://nightly.odoo.com/12.0/nightly/src/odoo_12.0.latest.zip
https://github.com/OCA/openupgradelib/archive/master.tar.gz
odoo12_addon_shopinvader_demo_app
```

Other available payment methods can be added from shopinvader-payment such as:

```
odoo12-addon-shopinvader-payment-stripe
odoo12-addon-shopinvader-payment-sips
```

Using <strong>python3</strong> install Shopinvader using the requirement.txt file with:

```
python -m pip install -r ./requirements.txt
```

Once Odoo is installed, install the module named '<strong>shopinvader_demo_app</strong>' which will install Shopinvader with some demo data.<br/>
You can do both with:

```
odoo -d odoo-shopinvader-easy -i shopinvader_demo_app -c ./odoo.cfg
```

With the content of odoo.cfg:

```
[options]
running_env=dev
workers = 3
server_wide_modules = web,queue_job
[queue_job]
channels = root:2
```

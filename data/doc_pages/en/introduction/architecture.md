### Search engine

Odoo sends the products and categories the search engine.

Locomotive and the user’s browser fetch products and categories from the search engine.
Why we need a search engine ? It offers us a very rich set of search features like facetting, search by synonyms and spelling. It’s effective and provides very good performance.

Shopinvader is compatible with 2 search engines: Algolia and Elasticsearch.

## Workflow

All components communicate between them as follows:


- Odoo push configuration to Locomotive.

- Odoo push products and categories to the search engine (Algolia/Elasticsearch).

- Locomotive fetch from the search engine products and categories.

- Locomotive push and fetch from Odoo carts and other customer information.
